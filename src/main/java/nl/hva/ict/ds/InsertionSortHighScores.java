 * Selection sort:
 * This approach will sort the list when a new player has been added to the high-score list.

 *
 * Your first approach is to sort the list with players after a new player has been added to the high-score list.
 * There are two different variants you want to investigate.
 * This variant looks a lot like the implementation your sister used,
 * but you suspect it to be more efficient because you just sort the list and donâ€™t have to duplicate it
 * and remove high- scores once they have been added to the list that is returned.
